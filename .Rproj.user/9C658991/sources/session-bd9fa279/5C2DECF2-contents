## Bio

I am a **Licensed Psychologist** and a **PhD Candidate** in Psychological Sciences at the University of Padova.

I am also a member of the **[Psicostat](https://psicostat.dpss.psy.unipd.it/)** research group, where we try to make sense of psychological data.

My work sits at the intersection of clinical psychology and quantitative methodology.

Currently, I am working on the development and application of **Inferential Multiverse Meta-analysis**. My goal is to investigate the robustness of the efficacy of psychotherapies, moving beyond simple effect sizes to understand how analytical choices shape scientific conclusions.
