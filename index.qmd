I am a **Licensed Psychologist** and **PhD Candidate** in Psychological Sciences at the University of Padova. I am also a member of the **[Psicostat](https://psicostat.dpss.psy.unipd.it/)** research group.

My research combines **clinical psychology** and **statistical methodology**, with the goal of improving the robustness and credibility of psychological research.

I am currently developing and applying **Inferential Multiverse Meta-analysis**, moving beyond single effect sizes to examine how analytical decisions shape scientific conclusions.
